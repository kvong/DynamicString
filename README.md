# Dynamic String Manipulator

### Description:
* This is a dynamic C-string library I created to do string manipulation through `char *`, as C language does not provide a library for such thing.

* Functions includes:
  - Tokenizer from `char*` to `char**`.
  - Read entire file into `char*`.
  - Get tokenized `char**` length.
  - Get length of `char*`.
  - Get number of lines in a file.
  - Read a specific line in a file.
